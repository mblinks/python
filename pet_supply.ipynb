The food, housing and medical categories have a comparable number of repeat purchases (151, 152, and 153 respectively). This was closely followed by the Toy category where 145 repeat purchases were recorded. Accesory accounted for 70 repeat purchases while the category named \"Unknown\" was the least in terms of repeat purchases (14).\n\nThe observations are not balanced across categories of repeat purchases. Only four of the categories (food, housing, medicine and toys) are approcimately equal in terms of repeat purchases with approximately 16-17% repeat purchase. The repeat purchase is spread in different proportion across other categories.\n\n![Comparison of repeat purchases across categories](Task 2.png)\n\n\n","metadata":{},"id":"1d5ba38c-1b3a-4f9b-bf38-bb0a62dac346","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## Task 3","metadata":{},"id":"ce5f6df2-fbf2-4c44-9209-9ee668876b53","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"Products with values between 875 and 1063 had the highest count of over 400.

However, there are several higher sales for repeat purchase products compared to the non repeat purchase product. \n\nThe violin plot comparing the sales of each category with repeat purchase shows that food has median repeat purchase sales above 1000 with fewer sales above 2000. More repeat purchase sales for medicine were made between 500 and 1000 compared to other sales for that category. Repeat purchase sales for the housing category are highly concentrated around the median sales value. The accessory category has a low density repeat purchase sales distribution with no outliers. Equipment category have two modes of repeat purchase sales with higher sales density above 1000. The toy category has the highest median repeat purchase value across all categories, it also recorded the highest sales outlier compared to others. The unknown category exhibited a normal distribution of repeat purchase sales with outliers at both ends. In all the relationship between sales and repeat purchase varied across groups.\n\n![Variation of repeat purchase sales across categories](Task 4.png)","metadata":{},"id":"170dd2ea-340f-4ab4-94c8-fe077342e98e","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## âœ… When you have finished...\n-  Publish your Workspace using the option on the left\n-  Check the published version of your report:\n\t-  Can you see everything you want us to grade?\n    -  Are all the graphics visible?\n-  Review the grading rubric.
