![Credit Risk Analysis](https://github.com/mblinks/mblinks.github.io/blob/main/assets/creditrisk.jpg)

In today's financial landscape, assessing credit risk is crucial for lenders and financial institutions. This dataset offers a simplified view of the factors that contribute to credit risk, making it an excellent opportunity for data scientists to apply their skills in machine learning and predictive modeling.

**Column Descriptions:**
- ID: Unique identifier for each loan applicant.								       		
- Age: Age of the loan applicant.	 			        		
- Income: Income of the loan applicant.
- Home: Home ownership status (Own, Mortgage, Rent).								       		
- Emp_Length: Employment length in years.	 			        		
- Intent: Purpose of the loan (e.g., education, home improvement).
- Amount: Loan amount applied for.								       		
- Rate: Interest rate on the loan.	 			        		
- Status: Loan approval status (Fully Paid, Charged Off, Current).
- Percent_Income: Loan amount as a percentage of income.								       		
- Default: Whether the applicant has defaulted on a loan previously (Yes, No).	 			        		
- Cred_Length: Length of the applicant's credit history.

Explore this dataset, preprocess the data as needed, and develop machine learning models, especially using Random Forest, to predict loan default. Your insights and solutions could contribute to better credit risk assessment methods and potentially help lenders make more informed decisions. 
Remember to respect data privacy and ethics guidelines while working with this data. Good luck, and happy analyzing!

Data has been collected from different hospitals, community clinics, maternal health cares through the IoT based risk monitoring system.

**Column Descriptions:**
- Age: Age in years when a woman is pregnant.								       		
- SystolicBP: Upper value of Blood Pressure in mmHg, another significant attribute during pregnancy.	 			        		
- DiastolicBP: Lower value of Blood Pressure in mmHg, another significant attribute during pregnancy.
- BS: Blood glucose levels is in terms of a molar concentration, mmol/L.								       		
- HeartRate: A normal resting heart rate in beats per minute.	 			        		
- Risk Level: Predicted Risk Intensity Level during pregnancy considering the previous attribute.
